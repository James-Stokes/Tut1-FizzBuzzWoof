# Tut1-FizzBuzzWoof
Woof branch has the for loops that popualte an array and check for numbers divisable by 3, 5 and 7 and replace them with Fizz, Buzz and Woof.
Arrays are 50 items long.
NOTE: this branch is in pre-beta testing and is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL the addition of the woof case could sevearly break the prgram and thats why this is a separate branch so that we can roll back any disasters. 
Use at own risk hehe ;)
